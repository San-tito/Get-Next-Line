| [get_next_line_utils.c](https://github.com/San-tito/get_next_line/blob/main/get_next_line_utils.c)             | The code in `get_next_line_utils.c` is part of a larger project directory called `get_next_line`. This specific file contains utility functions that are used in the implementation of the `get_next_line` function.The `check_for_newline` function checks if there is a newline character within the content of a linked list node. If there is, it returns 1, indicating that a line has been found. Otherwise, it returns 0.The `last_node` function returns a pointer to the last node in a linked list.The `add_node` function adds a new node to the end of a linked list, with the provided content.The `length_until_newline` function calculates the length of the content in a linked list until the first occurrence of a newline character.The `clear_nodes` function frees the memory allocated for the nodes in a linked list, including their content. |
| [get_next_line_bonus.h](https://github.com/San-tito/get_next_line/blob/main/get_next_line_bonus.h)             | The code provided is the header file get_next_line_bonus.h for a program that reads from a file and returns a line at a time. It includes necessary libraries and defines a struct and function prototypes. The struct t_list is used to store the content of each line and a pointer to the next line. The function prototypes define the operations to read and create lines, get a line from the list, extract any remaining content, check for a newline character, find the last node, add a new node, get the length until a newline, and clear the nodes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
